# COMPLETE ANALYSIS SUMMARY - AttendEdge RLS Policies

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of ALL aspects of the AttendEdge application and the complete RLS policy fixes implemented to resolve super admin access issues.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Super Admin Policies**
- No specific policies for `super_admin` role
- All policies only granted access to `admin` role
- Super admins couldn't access data across companies

### 2. **Company-Based Restrictions**
- All policies restricted by `company_id`
- Prevented super admins from viewing cross-company data
- Limited super admin functionality

### 3. **Inconsistent Table References**
- Application queries `profiles` table
- Some policies still referenced `employees` table
- Caused access issues and confusion

### 4. **Missing Table Coverage**
- Not all tables had RLS policies
- Missing policies for `holidays`, `system_settings`, `departments`
- Incomplete coverage of application functionality
